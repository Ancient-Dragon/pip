## An MVC Template to show us what you can do
This is your chance to show us what you can do with PHP, CSS, MySQL and Javascript. We've given you some ideas on things we'd like to see
but don't let that limit you.

Please leave comments and/or pseudo code for any areas that you were unable to finish or that you would have expanded on given more time.

Please Fork this Repository for your alterations, and please have fun with it.




# PIP

PIP is a tiny application framework built for LAMP stack. PIP aims to be as simple as possible to set up and use.

Visit [http://gilbitron.github.com/PIP](http://gilbitron.github.com/PIP/) for more information and documentation.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.1 or greater
* MySQL 4.1.2 or greater
* The mod_rewrite Apache module

## Installation

* Download PIP and extract
* Navigate to `application/config/config.php` and fill in your `base_url`
* You are ready to rock! Point your browser to your `base_url` and hopefully see a welcome message.


## Database

located at [https://github.com/AutomicWeb/pip/blob/master/ca_db.sql](https://github.com/AutomicWeb/pip/blob/master/ca_db.sql) Is a simple starter db.

## Things to Try
* Add bootstrap or similar css and stylesheets to style content.
* Add more pages to the website with a top nav to move between them.
* Create a login form that queries database for a user account before allowing access. Suggest using the session helper for controlling sessions. (will need a new USER table with new models controllers and views)
* Be creative, show us what you can do.
