# PIP

PIP is a tiny application framework built for LAMP stack. PIP aims to be as simple as possible to set up and use.

Visit [http://gilbitron.github.com/PIP](http://gilbitron.github.com/PIP/) for more information and documentation.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.1 or greater
* MySQL 4.1.2 or greater
* The mod_rewrite Apache module

## Installation

* Download PIP and extract
* Navigate to `application/config/config.php` and fill in your `base_url`
* You are ready to rock! Point your browser to your `base_url` and hopefully see a welcome message.


## Database

located at [https://github.com/AutomicWeb/pip/blob/master/ca_db.sql](https://github.com/AutomicWeb/pip/blob/master/ca_db.sql) Is a simple starter db.

## Things to Try
* Add bootstrap or similar css and stylesheets to style content.
* Add more pages to the website with a top nav to move between them.
* Create a login form that queries database for a user account before allowing access. Suggest using the session helper for controlling sessions. (will need a new USER table, suggest also new models controllers and views for this)
* Be creative, show us what you can do.
